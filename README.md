# Deep MRS Quantification
This repository provides the implementation of DeepFPC from the following paper:

Model-Constrained Deep Learning Approach to the Quantification of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Data Based on Linear Combination Model Fitting: [Link to biorxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.13.512064v1)

## How does it work?
- DeepMRS was implemented in Python with the help of the Pytorch lightning interface. 
- For each experiment, a "run" json file should be created. All parameters of the deep neural network and data can be stated in the json file.
There are examples of "run" json files that can be found in the "runs" folder.
- The network can be trained and tested simply by running "main.py". 
- Engine.py controls the pre and post-training steps for training and testing. dotrain() and dotest() are two functions for training and testing modes, respectively.
- Model.py is an object inherited from PyTorch lightning's "LightningModule". Now it contains four neural networks (ConvNet, MLPNet, mlp-Mixer, and ConvNext), but you can easily add your model.  Model-decoder are implemented in Model.py (forward function).
